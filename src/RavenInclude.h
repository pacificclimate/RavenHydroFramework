 NAMING AND PROGRAMMING CONVENTIONS IN RAVEN LIBRARY
------------------------------------------------------------------

all classes are named beginning with a capital C
all water/energy mover process classes are named beginning with Cmv
all constants/enumerated types are ALL CAPITALS

pointers to OBJECTS (not basic data types) or arrays of pointers to OBJECTS start with p
array sizes start with n followed by capital letters (e.g, nStateVars)
dynamic arrays start with a followed by capital letters (e.g., aStateVars)

counters- i    loops through state variables
          j    loops through Hydrological/Energy Processes
               loops through local constituent indices (CTransport)
          k    loops through HRUs
          kk   loops through land surface elements, HRU groups
          m    loops through soil layers, soil horizons and multilayer variables
          q    loops through connections between storage units/state vars
          c    loops through transported constituents
               loops through soil, lult, terrain, & vegetation classes
          n    loops through time series pulses
               loops through time arrays [in subbasin history]
          p,pp loops through subbasins, soil profiles
          g    loops through gauges
UNITS: all time units in days
       all vertical flux rates in mm/day
       all routing flow rates in m3/s
       all energy fluxes in MJ/m2/d
       all energy storage in terms of temp, C or MJ/m2
       all water storage units in mm
       all constituent storage units in mg/m2
       property units are those most commonly used
    -units outside these conventions should be used LOCALLY
    -if a constant is used in units conversion, the named variable
     (e.g., MM_PER_INCH) is ALWAYS to be used. That way, someone
     can look at the code and figure out what the mystery number means!
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Other comments:
  -processes that rely upon system memory (i.e., something is
   triggered 6 days after snow starts melting) are STRONGLY discouraged:
   the model should be able to stop and be restarted with final conditions
   as initial conditions to the next run, as is consistent with a
   mechanistic model
